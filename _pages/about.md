I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Newcastle University with a background in Chemical Engineering. 

My research interests lie in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and molecular simulations. Currently, my work centers on advancing solid-state batteries, though I am also passionate about the field of crystal nucleation and membrane separation.
