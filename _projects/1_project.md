Crystal nucleation is a fundamental process occurring throughout nature, yet our understanding of its mechanisms remains limited.
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are powerful tools well-suited to investigate nucleation due to their capacity to capture relevant time and length scales. I
n our research, we employ MD simulations alongside the RSeeds {% cite Yuan:2023:JPCB %} technique, a heterogeneous seeding method, to study heterogeneous ice nucleation.
This approach allows us to probe the intricate dynamics of ice formation on various substrates, providing insights into the fundamental principles governing crystallization in complex environments.
