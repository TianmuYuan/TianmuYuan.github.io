Membranes are a promising technology for gas separation, yet a comprehensive understanding of the fluid transport and separation mechanisms remains challenging.

In this research, we explore the application of Dynamic Mean Field Theory (DMFT) to gain deeper insights into these processes.
This approach helps address fundamental questions, such as why sorption selectivity often exceeds perm-selectivity in sorption-driven membrane systems {% cite Yuan:2023:JCP %}, and how 2D nanoflake fillers—despite being non-porous—enhance separation performance in mixed matrix membranes {% cite Yuan:2024:ACSAMI %}.

By applying DMFT, we aim to uncover the molecular interactions and structural factors that drive efficient gas separation, ultimately contributing to the design of more effective membrane materials.
